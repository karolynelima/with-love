Yours Truly,Honeymoon Avenue,"Shoo-doo-doo-dum-doo, da-da
Shoo-doo-doo-dum-doo, da-da
Sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da
(Da-da) Uh-uh
(Da-da) Ooh, yeah
(Da-da) Mmm, ah
(Da-da) It's the Rascals

I looked in my rearview mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we found it (Found it)
Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)
You're sayin', ""Baby, don't worry""
But we're still goin' the wrong way

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And, sometimes, I feel like we've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know, yeah
We can find our way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, my baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in—
Traffic, I'm under
Pressure, pressure—
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue
Avenue
Let's just go back, b-b-b-back, back, back"
Yours Truly,Baby I,"Baby, I got love for thee so deep inside of me
I don't know where to start (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I love you more than anything
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, no (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I try to explain it, I be soundin' insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied (And twisted)
I can't explain what (I'm feelin')
And I say, ""Baby, baby"" (Oh-woah-woah), ""Baby""

(Baby, I) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh, baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (Oh-woah-woah)

Baby, I'm so down for you
No matter what'cha do (Real talk), I'll be around (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Straight up, you got me (Ah-ah) all in
(How) Could I not be?
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)
If it's even possible, I love you more
Than the word ""love"" can say (Say)
It's better not explaining
That's why I keep saying ""Baby, I""

(Baby, I) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh, baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby

You got it, you got it, babe (See ya)
You got it, you got it, babe (Got it, huh?)
You got it, you got it, babe (Sean Don)
You got it, you got it, babe

Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out lookin' like a model
God, doin' what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon (Moon)
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you? (Got you, I got you)

Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally, the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

You know what I need (Ayy), I know what you like (Ayy)
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright (Hey)
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you, I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go

You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (Right there)
Right there (Right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different, no one compares
And if you'll never change, I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time (Track of time)

'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different, no one compares
And if you'll never change, I'm gonna stay right there (What? Okay)
I'll always be right there (What?)

Now, if it all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement? (What?)
If my Benz turned back to public transportation (Swerve, swerve)
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waitin'? (What?)
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player, too, you know I have some girls missionary (Ooh)
My black book of numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled, I love and I like you
Five-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go (I got you)

You should know (Oh), I'm never gonna change (I'm never gonna change; Woah)
I'm always gonna stay (I'm always gonna stay; Oh)
You call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there)
Right there (Ooh)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different, no one compares
And if you'll never change (B-I-G Sean Don)
I'm gonna stay right there (Carry on)
I'll always be right there (Yeah)

I'll always be right there
You got it, you got it, babe (If you wanna party, put your hands up;Gods)
You got it, you got it, babe (Put your hands up)
You got it, you got it, babe (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
You got it, you got it, babe (Put your hands up, put your hands up)

Yours Truly,Tattooed Heart,"You don't need a lot of money
Honey, you don't have to play no games
All I need is all your lovin'
To get the blood rushing through my veins, oh
I wanna say we're going steady, oh

Ooh, oh (Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-ah, hey

You don't need to worry about making me crazy

How much I want to be on your tattooed heart

Oh (Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh, ah (Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart

Wrap me in your jacket, my baby

Yours Truly,Piano,"Oh-woah
Oh-woah
There we go

I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'd find out that my heart was battered
Real hard (Real hard)
It's so hard (It's so hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano

I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle

Yours Truly,Almost Is Never Enough,"I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time, our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows, oh

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart (Ah)
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough (Ah)

If I could change the world overnight (Ah)
There'd be no such thing as goodbye (Ah)
You'd be standing right where you were (Ah)
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh (Ah)

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time, our feelings will show (Ah)
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows (Ah)

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you, woah
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here (Right here) in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

Now you're workin' at the movies sellin' popular corn
I coulda been a mess, but I never went wrong
'Cause I'm puttin' down my story in a popular song (La-la, la-la)
Ah-ah, I said I'm puttin' down my story in a popular song

My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singin' all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row 'cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go (Hey)

Always on the lookout for someone to hate
Pickin' on me like a dinner plate
You hid during classes and in-between 'em
Dunk me in the toilets, now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughin', got everyone clappin', askin'
How come you look so cool?
'Cause that's the only thing that I learned at school, boy
Uh-huh, I said that's the only thing that I learned at school

My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singin' all the songs I don't know

I can't deny, I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know ""sorry"" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing

Bubbles and bubbly, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never
Act this regular

Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes

Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world

Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, ""Ooh""
Feels like forever, baby, I never
Thought that it would be you
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit
That's how I know it's true
Baby, direct it, name in the credits
Like the movies do

Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes

Imagine a world like that

I wanna trust me (Trust me)

Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawin', got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

I wanna love me (Ooh)

How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?
Aren't you really s'posed to know that shit?
Feel it in your bones and own that shit? I don't know
Then I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks
Wonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling
Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me
Wonder if he's judgin' me like I am right now

I don't care
I'd rather tell the truth (Truth)
Than make it worse for you, mm (You)

If the sun refused to shine
Baby, would I still be your lover?
Would you want me there?
If the moon went dark tonight
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would you be the one on mine?"

This ain't the first time I've been hostage to these tears
I can't believe I'm finally movin' through my fears
At least I know how hard we tried, both you and me
Didn't we? Didn't we?

Usually, I'd join you on the floor, but this dance ain't for me
Boy, just turn the music up
Maybe someday, we'll look back with love
Didn't think you'd lose me
Now it's just too late to choose me

Spent so much on therapy
Blamed my own codependency

When you finally did, it was at the wrong time
Won't abandon me again for you and I, I

So we say goodbye
Just one kiss goodbye
With tears in our eyes
Hope you won't, won't regret me
Hope you'll still think fondly of our little life

eternal sunshine,Saturn Returns Interlude,"When we're all born, Saturn's somewhere
And the Saturn cycle takes around about twenty-nine years
That's when we gotta wake up and smell the coffee
Because if we've just been sort of relying on our cleverness
Or relying—, you know, just kind of floating along
Saturn comes along and hits you over the head
Hits you over the head, hits you over the head, and says, ""Wake up""
Aha, it's time for you to get real about life and sort out who you really are

Wake up
Get real"
